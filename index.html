<!--Welcome to "Projects Fuego..." Just follow along with comments like this one, and you'll design a really cool webtext that not only introduces you, your skills, and interests to the rest of the class, but also builds your coding literacy. Refer to the repository README for GitHub publishing help.-->

<!--BTW. You can leave these faded code comments be, or delete them. Programmers and web designers use these comments to better explain what the code is doing for others who may enter the document later. They are but road signs, absent from the larger design-->

<!--HTML pages start by calling <!DOCTYPE html> and designating a language.-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <!--Next comes the <head> information including the title and all of the important links that make the webtext work. When a browser access your url, it looks first at the index.html document <head> to learn about the names and locations of the other files and assets it will need to assemble your code into a visual display.-->

  <!--Go ahead and fill in the blank in <title>I am...</title> (see just below). The <title> will appear in your document's browser tab-->
<title>I am Aaron</title>
<!--The stuff below the title does important work to tell browsers what this page should look like on different screens-->
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
<!--Next is a link to the cascading style sheet or CSS. Web designers use a cascading stylesheet CSS to add styling to a website. Designers do this by "calling" a <div class> in HTML and defining the class attributes on the style sheet. Doing so saves time and results in less code. On the style.css page you'll find attributes relating font, text size, image size, among other details.-->
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">
</head>


<body>
<!--Now we will start working in the body of the document. The body holds all of the code and content that will appear as a visual for our audience.-->

<!--Designers refer to this next section as a "Hero Image." The hero image is styled on the style.css page by calling a "class." To replace the hero image, simply place a .jpg file in the same file folder (directory) as this project and name it "hero.jpg." Alternatively, if you are working with a .png, you will need to open the style.css file using your text editor, find the "hero-image" class and change the file type from ".jpg" to ".png."" Browsers will only work with .jpg, .jpeg, or .png images. Since hero images need to stretch across the screen, typically you will want to select an image 1200px in width to allow quick load time yet avoid pixilation.-->

<!--We'll use this first section to discuss where you are right now. Where do you go to school and what courses are you taking/enjoying. What majors/minors/certificates are you pursuing? Has this changed? Why? Replace the content between <h3> and </h3> that says "Lorem ipsum" etc -->


<!--Fuego programs sometimes use "in-line styling" to provide quick fixes to content design. In the above case, you could change "left" to "right" or "center" depending on your specific design needs. That said, left align is usually best practice for improving readability.-->

  <h2>Field of Study</h2>
  <h3>I am a senior Statistics major at the University of Pittsburgh on the Pre-Medical track. I am also pursuing a minor in Chemistry and a Certificate in the Conceptual Foundations of Medicine. I am taking three statistics courses, a medical philosophy course, and a design course in this semester. </h3>

<!--Replace the images here. You can also control max-image width%. Keep your file names simple, don't use spaces, and be case sensitive). Be sure to add alt="text." Visually impaired individuals using screen readers rely on alt="text" to describe pictures to them. Describe your image as clearly and succinctly as possible.-->

<!--What experience do you have to leverage in this class? Are you a writer, are you a maker, are you a designer, are you a thinker or critic? What is your medium/media? What interests you about that medium/those media? What media/skills do you wish to learn more about/pursue in this class?-->

<div class="textblock" style="text-align: left">
  <h2>Knowledge, Tools, and Skills</h2>
    <h3>I currently do research at a lab at UPMC Children's Hospital. My main role is data analysis, which involves making visualization of my results. I generally first make various graphs/figures using the programming language R, and then edit those graphs/figures in Adobe Illustrator to make them publication quality. One of the reasons I am taking this class is so I can learn to make figures more effectively. I also want to learn how to use tools like Photoshop for my own interests.</h3>

<!--Quick fact: Did you know "Lorem ipsum," the fill text used in this web template, was hacked out of Cicero's "De finibus bonorum et malorum"? Developers made it non-sensical, so don't bother with Google Translate.-->

<!--So, what exactly is good design? Take some time to explain your design interests...defining it, providing examples, explaining why is it important/significant-->
<div class="textblock" style="text-align: left">
  <h2>What is good design?</h2>
      <h3>
        <p>I feel like a good design is something that conveys what it wants to convey in a effective and visually appealing way. I think conveying infromation effectively involves communicating your message in a concise and/or entertaining way. I feel like this is important because it makes your audience want to read your message. I feel like making your design visually appealing is important because it makes you audience want to look at your design.</p> 
        <p>I think a good example of this is NFL TV scoreboards like the one below. It conveys all the information you want to know, such as the score and the gameclock, in a concise and easy to read way. I think the design of the score board is visually appealing because it makes you want to look at it by not being overly complex or hard to read. </p>

        <p>I think another good example of a good design is the Citroen 2CV ad below. It conveys its message that the car is a nice everyday driver in a comedic way, while also telling you information about the car, such as its price and storage space. The ad also makes you want to look at it because of the seemingly nonsense statements and "cooler" cars on it.</p>

        <p>I think another good example of a good design is the Rstudio interface. Again like the NFL scoreboard it conveys all the information you want to know, such as your code and the objects in the environment, in a concise and easy to read way. I think the design is also visually appealing because alll of the icons and negative space.</p>

<!--Let's talk a little about the future. After school what kind of job or career would you like to pursue? What is your reasoning for going on this path? How might it connect to all of these prior elements-field of study, home and family, interests and activities? How might the work we do in this space help you to realize this future?-->

   <h2>In the Future</h2>
      <h3>As stated above, I am on the Pre-Medical track; therefore, after undergrad, I want to go to Medical School and become a doctor. I want to go down this path because I find the job interesting, and I feel like it is a way for me to use my skills to have a positive impact on the world. The work we do in this space could help me realize this future by allowing me to create a visually appealing summary of my past experiences, which could help me in my medical school applications.</h3>
